# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This days most of us take hundreds of pictures weekly. With this numbers it's almost impossible to keep track of our best moment in life. Pictures need to be organized to be accessible; at the same time this isn't a trivial matter and could result in a tedious activity for the user.
Our web app intend to solve this issues, in particular is going to offer a way to classify pictures or groups of pictures by date, location, event, author and people in the picture. The classification will allow the user to retrieve the pictures using a search features and to create thematic albums. We already mention that this activity could be tedious so we would help the user by offering a auto-classification through a facial recognition feature and through a album suggestion feature.

### Features
* Pictures upload
* Photo gallery
* Access to pictures metadata
* Form submission for picture classification
* Search database by date, location, events and people
* Creation and visualization of photo albums
* Facial recognition
* Album suggestion feature

### Technologies
* Asp.Net MVC
* SQL (maybe a hybrid database like MongoDB)
* FACE API Microsoft Azure
* Azure Neural Network or a simple model to made the album suggestion possible

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to use the FACE API, in order to detect faces and develop a machine learning process to recognize them.  The more ambitious learning opportunity will be dedicated to the Neural Network, it would be possible that the feature (album suggestion feature) that probably require the Neural Network won't be developed in time by the end of the Liftoff.
